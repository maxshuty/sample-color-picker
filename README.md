# Color Picker
Learn about native web components by building a simple color picker app.

My goal with this was too make a reusable color picker that is totally independent of other color pickers. A user should be able to add more color pickers dynamically by pressing a button. Finally, I wanted this to be accessible. With all of that in mind, this is the solution that I came up with.

## Bonus challenge
Take this repo and make the colors dynamic where a user can pass in any valid list of CSS colors for each component!
